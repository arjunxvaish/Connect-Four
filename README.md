This Connect Four game system has been developed using Verilog, it is designed to provide an intuitive and interactive gaming experience on the DE1-SoC board. The game utilizes physical switches to select columns for token placement, while the LED matrix displays the current state of the game board. The game interface includes 7-segment displays that indicate the current player and the winner, enhancing the user experience. The system effectively demonstrates digital design concepts such as finite state machines (FSM), synchronization techniques, and edge detection. It leverages the FPGA's capability to handle multiple parallel processes, ensuring responsive gameplay and accurate real-time feedback.
